We implemented the following additional feature(s):
DESIGN:
- A client can log into multiple sessions and be a part of multiple sessions at the same time
- When sending a message to a particular session, the client has
  to type in: <session_id>: <message> Note the space after the
  colon
- A client can leave a session by typing leavesession <session_id>
- Other commands like login, quit, createsession, logout remain 
  unchanged.

Example Run:
Terminal 1-
server 4950

Terminal 2-
/login bob BOB 127.0.0.1 4950
/createsession haha

Terminal 3-
/login alice ALICE 127.0.0.1 4950

Terminal 4-
